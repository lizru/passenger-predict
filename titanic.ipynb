    "## 7. Conclusion & Potential Improvement\n",
    "The Random Forest Classifier created above provides a baseline for predicting Titanic survival, but there is room for improvement. Cross validation with 10 folds was used to achieve an accuracy of approximately 81.7%, with the hold-out test achieving 81.4% accuracy.  The classification report tells us that this model is slightly weaker at predicting survivors, and sometimes incorrectly predicts survivors where there are none. The precision score for Survived tells us that only 74% of the passengers predicted to survive were in fact survivors, implying room for finer tuning. The recall for survivors tells us that 81% of the predicted survivors did survive, but there are some false negatives. The F1 scores, which balances precision and recall, are 84% for non-survivors and 77% for survivors More precise feature engineering to consider nuanced interactions between variables could boost accuracy. Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the model could also improve it. Further, using a gradient boosting method such as an XGBoost model would likely provide an increase in accuracy in exchange for more precise tuning. "
